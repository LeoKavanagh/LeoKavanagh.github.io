More adventures in simple Javascript on shared web hosting.

Recently I started drawing as way to wind down in the evenings
without looking at a screen. Naturally, I took this as an opportunity
to build a simple web app that's tangentially related to this.

We use the [Canny Edge Detector](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canny_edge_detector)
to extract edges and lines from the image. This algorithm comes out of the box
with OpenCV, but it would be a fun exercise to implement the entire thing myself.
I'll leave that for Version 2. There are a couple of arguments to the `canny`
function but I hard coded ones that worked well enough for me.

I used [this Stack Overflow answer](https://stackoverflow.com/a/18387322)
to paste images into HTML Canvas elements.
Initially I played with a bit of Ajax to send the image to a Flask
backend for processing in OpenCV Python, but it turned out to be much easier
to just use OpenCV.js in the browser instead. The basic example
from the [OpenCV.js tutorial](https://docs.opencv.org/4.5.3/d0/d84/tutorial_js_usage.html)
was pretty much all I needed.

Finally, I ignored CSS entirely, because that chimes with the minimalism
of pulling black and white lines out of complex images, and also because I'm
not very good at it.
